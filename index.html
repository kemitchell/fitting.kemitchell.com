      <h2>Do Not</h2>
      <h3 id="yoursize">Assume your size will be the same.</h3>
      <p>One shoe sized “US 9” or “EU 40” may be longer, shorter, wider, narrower, higher, lower, or just a different shape than another one sized the same way. Brands differ, and even models within brands. Even if they all claim “true to size”.</p>
      <p>Shoe shapes aren’t that standardized. This will annoy you until you realize you’ve never met anyone with “average” feet, yours are unique, too, and all this variation puts something out there to <em>really</em> fit nearly everyone.</p>
      <h3 id="thumb">Stick your thumb in front of your toes.</h3>
      <p>This protects salespeople from parents whose children outgrow their shoes too fast.</p>
      <p>You’re grown now. Live long enough, your feet <em>shrink</em>.</p>
      <h3 id="stretch">Expect tight shoes to stretch.</h3>
      <p>Sturdy leather shoes will break <em>you</em> in. Disposable sneakers break down.</p>
      <p>People who <a href="#bigger">want to buy too small</a>, suffer, and bust them out are great for bad business. They take unwanted sizes out of the back. They blow through sneakers faster.</p>
      <h3 id="slip">Freak out if your heel slips a little.</h3>
      <p>Expect your heels might rise and fall just a little to start. Especially in traditional leather shoes and work boots. Double especially in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_boot">Western</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_boot">Wellington</a> boots.</p>
      <p>Studier soles push back against <a href="#bend">bending</a> when new. The shafts of Westerns and Wellingtons crease, slouch down, and help trap your heels.</p>
      <h3 id="advice">Follow the first advice that lets you click “Buy”.</h3>
      <p>Well meaning individuals can only tell you what they think worked for them. They have no idea what your toes look like, how your arches flex, or how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last">molds for the shoes</a> measure up. I have no idea.</p>
      <p>Real foot nerds will want more data. They’ll probably send you after a measuring device, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brannock_device">Brannock device</a>. They’ll be honest about helping you toward a guess. And that guessing’s a far second-best to trying on.</p>

      <h2>Do</h2>
      <h3 id="bigger">Try bigger shoes.</h3>
      <p>Left alone, people just seem to pick shoes too small. It causes all kinds of problems. Feet nerds have been complaining about it for centuries.</p>
      <p>It’s not everybody all the time. But if you haven’t thought about this before, try a size up next time you’re in a store or buying online with free returns.</p>
      <h3 id="bend">Find shoes that bend where your feet do.</h3>
      <p>Take off your shoes and find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsophalangeal_joints">big foot-knuckle</a> where the bottom of your big toe bends. Press your toes into the ground and keep them there. Lift your heel, then feel the bone on the inside of your foot.</p>
      <p>When you put a shoe on and lace up, that bone needs to land in the widest part of the front of the shoe, where it’s designed to bend. Poke the side of the shoe with your finger and find the bone.</p>
      <h3 id="pain">Accept no pain.</h3>
      <p>You shouldn’t feel craming, pinching, or poking anywhere in your shoes. Pointy <em>styles</em> are fine, as long as your curvy <em>toes</em> lay comfortably behind the pointy part.</p>
      <p>Try a half size bigger, <em>if</em> it still <a href="#bends">bends right</a>. If they have them, try a step <em>wider</em>, like “E”, “EE”, or “F” width, relative to “standard” men's “D”.</p>
      <h3 id="conditions">Wear the same socks, late in the day.</h3>
      <p>Thicker socks make your feet slightly bigger. Your feet also swell a bit through the day.</p>
      <h3 id="fasten">Make sure you can fasten in.</h3>
      <p>If lacing or buckling up pulls the eyelets right together, with your foot still flopping or slipping around inside, there’s too much room inside. Try a lower or <a href="https://narrowwidthshoes.kemitchell.com/">narrower shoe</a> size if there is one. If there isn't, try a half size down, but make sure it still <a href="#bends">bends right</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="same">Expect your feet to differ.</h3>
      <p>Almost nobody’s feet come perfectly symmetrical. Most people vary a bit in length, width, and shape foot to foot.</p>
      <p>Wear the shoes that fits the larger foot without problems.</p>
      <h3 id="giveup">Give up sometimes.</h3>
      <p>Somestimes a model just won’t work for you, even if it comes in a bunch of different lenghts, widths, or other sizes.</p>
