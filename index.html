    <h1>Fitting Shoes</h1>
    <p>simple do’s and don’ts from a guy who screwed it up a lot</p>

      <h2>Do Not</h2>
      <h3 id="same">Assume your size will be the same.</h3>
      <p>One shoe sized “US 9” or “EU 40” may be longer, shorter, wider, narrower, higher, lower, or just a different shape than another one sized the same way. Brands differ, and even models within brands. Even if they all claim “true to size”.</p>
      <p>Shoe shapes aren’t that standardized. This will annoy you until you realize you’ve never met anyone with “average” feet, yours are unique, too, and all this variation puts something out there to <em>really</em> fit nearly everyone.</p>
      <h3 id="thumb">Stick your thumb in front of your toes.</h3>
      <p>This protects salespeople from parents whose kids outgrow their shoes too fast.</p>
      <p>You’re grown now. Live long enough, your feet <em>shrink</em>.</p>
      <h3 id="stretch">Expect tight shoes to stretch.</h3>
      <p>Sturdy leather shoes will break <em>you</em> in. Disposable sneakers break <em>down</em>.</p>
      <p>People who <a href="#bigger">want to buy too small</a>, suffer, and bust them out are great for bad business. They take unwanted sizes out of the back. They blow through sneakers faster.</p>
      <h3 id="slip">Freak out if your heel slips a little.</h3>
      <p>Expect your heels might rise and fall just a little to start. Especially in traditional leather shoes and work boots. Double especially in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_boot">Western</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_boot">Wellington</a> boots.</p>
      <p>Sturdier soles push back against <a href="#bend">flexing</a> when new. The shafts of Westerns and Wellingtons crease, slouch down, and help trap your heels.</p>
      <h3 id="advice">Follow the first advice that lets you click “Buy”.</h3>
      <p>Well meaning Internet people can only tell you what they think worked for them. They have no idea what your toes look like, how your arches flex, or how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last">molds for the shoes</a> measure up. I have no idea.</p>
      <p>Real foot nerds will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTqTtR0X-Gw">want</a> <a href="https://whitesboots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/WHI-Measurement-Sheet-2.pdf">more</a> <a href="https://builder.wescoboots.com/images/catalog/Custom_Fit_Form.pdf?202102101230">data</a>. At a minimum, they’ll probably send you after a measuring gizmo, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brannock_device">Brannock device</a>. They’ll be honest about helping you toward a guess. And that guessing’s a far second-best to trying on.</p>
      <h3 id="stick">Buy whatever the measuring stick says.</h3>
      <p>While some foot sizing systems like the Brannock device or Paris points <em>are</em> “standard” in the shoe world, they’re standard for measuring feet, not shoes. You should’t just order whatever number you read on their scales.</p>
      <p>Sizing is <a href="#same">not that standardized</a>.</p>

      <h2>Do</h2>
      <h3 id="bigger">Try bigger shoes.</h3>
      <p>Left alone, people just seem to pick shoes too small. It causes all kinds of problems. Feet nerds have been <a href="https://archive.org/details/amanualonfootca00folsgoog/page/n20/mode/2up">complaining about it forever</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s not everybody all the time. But if you haven’t thought about this before, try a size up next time you’re in a store. Or buying online with free returns.</p>
      <h3 id="bend">Find shoes that bend where your feet do.</h3>
      <p>Take off your shoes and find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsophalangeal_joints">the big foot-knuckle</a> at the bottom of your big toe. Press your toes into the ground and keep them there. Lift your heel, then feel the bony nub on the inside of your foot where your big toe bends up.</p>
      <p>When you put a shoe on, that joint needs to line up with the widest part, where it's built to flex. Rub the side of the shoe with your finger and find your bone.</p>
      <h3 id="pain">Accept no pain.</h3>
      <p>Except for maybe <a href="#slip">a little heel slip</a>, you shouldn’t feel cramming, pinching, poking, or rubbing anywhere in your shoes. Pointy <em>shoe toes</em> are fine, as long as your curvy <em>foot toes</em> lay flat and comfortable behind the pointy bits.</p>
      <p>If you’re getting smooshed, try any wider widths they have, like “E”, “EE”, or “F”, wider than “standard” men’s “D”. Try a half size bigger <em>if</em> it still <a href="#bends">flexes with you</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="conditions">Wear the same socks, late in the day.</h3>
      <p>Thicker socks make your feet slightly bigger. Your feet also swell a bit through the day.</p>
      <h3 id="fasten">Make sure you can fasten in.</h3>
      <p>If lacing up pulls the lace holes right together, with your foot still flopping or slipping around inside, there’s too much room. Try a lower or <a href="https://narrowwidthshoes.kemitchell.com/">narrower shoe</a> size if there is one. If there isn’t, try a half size down, but make sure it still <a href="#bends">flexes with you</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="differ">Expect your feet to differ.</h3>
      <p>Almost nobody’s feet are mirror images. Most people vary a bit in length, width, and shape.</p>
      <p>Wear the shoes that fits the larger foot without problems.</p>
      <h3 id="giveup">Give up sometimes.</h3>
      <p>Cool shoes out there just won’t work for you, even if they come in a <a href="https://www.allenedmonds.com/mens-shoes/extended-sizes">bunch</a> <a href="https://www.redwingshoes.com/work/mens/soft-toe/traction-tred-10877.html">of</a> <a href="https://whitesboots.com/product-sizing/">different</a> lengths and widths. Sometimes it’s not worth making it work with thick socks, insoles, heel shims, tongue pads, or other tricks. Sometimes there aren’t any tricks.</p>
